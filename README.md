# PythonTriCities September2018_2nd_Tuesday.

Tonight we are looking at lists and dictionaries

In Python a list is enclosed in square brackets
['a', 'list']

In Python a dictionaries are enclosed with curly brackets and have
a key and a value seperated by a full colon :
{'key': 'Value', 'name': 'Galahad'}
